# ThirdDimension

### Two-Sided Marketplace

Designed and Developed by
Anthony Mann 2021

Third Dimension is a two-sided marketplace for the sale of Dioramas, 3D printer Models, and associated files. The current marketplace is underdeveloped and not very accessible for all those who wish to create and sell their amazing creations or for those who wish to order one-of-a-kind Dioramas or purchase 3D model designs online.

This is a problem that I feel needs to be addressed as I have often found myself looking to purchase Dioramas that people have created, however, there is very limited availability, especially within Australia.
